- Repository for CS5167 User Interface I project #2, Alterna-Canvas, the game.
- Developed by Jack Margeson, Alex Yang, Kody Penn, and Al Ayoola.

## Sketches
In our mission to redesign Canvas, our team iterated over several designs through a 10-10 sketching process. Below are the sketches that we generated using Discord Whiteboard, a collaborative drawing tool. Many of these preliminary ideas were incorporated into our final design. Before each set of sketches, we present the central question/problem statement that'd we'd like to address in our Alterna Canvas project, with a short summary of the importance of the statement.

#### 1. Displaying important information like assignments, grades, and classes to our users.

#### 2. Keeping a user engaged and rewarded while using the platform's gamification features.

#### 3. Letting teachers influence the content and rewards that are being served to students.

#### Additional design challenge sketching

Below, we iterate and expand on some of the ideas presented in the inital sketching session. The three solutions that we picked from our inital ideas were "Students can customize their own menu" for Design Challenge 1, "Point shop systems" for Design Challenge 2, and "Personalized learning paths" for Design Challenge 3.

#### Preliminary final design sketches

Our team then worked on creating some preliminary final sketches for what the main page would look like in our Alterna Canvas, which are shown below.

The final decision that we made was to go with a design reminiscent of the orignal Canvas design with features more clearly laid out and accessable for users. One of the final sketches, shown below, became the basis for our general site layout.

The site layout sketch was translated into an assortment of flexboxes for the purpose of laying out where our components live, shown in the screenshot below.

## Interviews 

Several interviews were conducted by each member of the team to create a comprehensive view of what people who use Canvas think about the current design and functionality. Within this GitHub repository, all full interview documents can be found in the [project documentation folder under interviews](https://github.com/jack-margeson/alterna-canvas/tree/main/project-documentation/interviews). A summary of common points that were brought up across the interviews:
- common point 1
- common point 2

## Contextual Inquiry

In addition to traditional interviews, the members of our team conducted contextual inquiries on Canvas users. With limited instruction from our interviewers, our interviewees were instructed to do various tasks on the Canvas website in order for us to study how they would accomplish a given task and whether or not their use of the program differed from our experiences using Canvas. All full contextual inquiries conducted can also be found in the [project documentation folder under contextual interviews](https://github.com/jack-margeson/alterna-canvas/tree/main/project-documentation/contextual-inquiries). A summary of interesting found differences from the contextual inquiries:
- interesting point 1
- interesting point 2

## Project Requirements

Following the sketching and ideation phase as ewll as the interviews/contextual inquiry phase, our team set aside some time to talk about what information we gained from these activites as we formed a list of project requirements that our project was to include alongside the mandatory requirements as dictated by the assignment. The project requirements that we worked towards with the Alterna Canvas project are listed here:
- requirement 1
- requirement 2
